What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
  Pros
    - can track changes better (with good comments)
    - fewer unrelated changes between versions
  Cons
    - can still lose changes if you don't use it correctly

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
  So that you can capture all changes related to a single feature or fix together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?  Log shows the revisions with commit comments (--stats shows more info)
  Diff shows difference between two commits (don't have to be next to each other)

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
  You know you can get back to a stable state.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
  Nothing
